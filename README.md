## Overview

The Grocery Store CI/CD Pipeline is designed to automate the building, testing, and deployment of the grocery store web application. This pipeline incorporates security scanning, infrastructure management with Terraform, and deployment to Kubernetes, ensuring a robust and scalable application.

## Features

- **Automated Builds**: Automatically builds the application upon code changes.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Integrates OWASP Dependency Check to identify and report vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
- **Docker Support**: Creates and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub, facilitating easy deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Utilizes Terraform to manage Kubernetes infrastructure, allowing for version-controlled deployments.
- **ELK Stack Integration**: Deploys the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for centralized logging and monitoring.
- **Automated Deployment**: Uses Docker Compose to orchestrate application containers seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **Jenkins**: For building and orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Kubernetes**: For deploying and managing the application at scale.
- **Terraform**: For Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage cloud infrastructure.
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: For identifying vulnerabilities in application dependencies.
- **Node.js**: The backend framework for the grocery store web application.
